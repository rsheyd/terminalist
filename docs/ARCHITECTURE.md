## Data Management

### Local Storage
- Data is cached locally in a **file-backed SQLite database**
- The database is retained between runs; synchronization refreshes it without deleting the usable cache at startup
- Backend configuration currently stores the Todoist API token as unencrypted JSON credentials in the database; see [Privacy and Local Data](../PRIVACY.md)
- Uses Sea-ORM for type-safe database operations
- Repository pattern provides clean data access layer
- UUID-based primary keys for robust entity management

### Sync Behavior
- **First Run**: Automatically syncs all data from Todoist
- **Startup**: Opens the retained cache and starts synchronization through the Todoist backend
- **Incremental Sync**: Persists Todoist Sync API tokens transactionally and falls back to a full sync when a token is rejected
- **Manual Sync**: Press `r` to force refresh from Todoist API
- **Sync Indicators**: Sync progress is shown during operations

### Data Types
- **Backends**: Abstract backend entity supporting multiple task management services (Todoist, etc.)
- **Projects**: Hierarchical structure with parent-child relationships
- **Sections**: Project sections for organizing tasks
- **Tasks**: Full task details including labels, priority, and status
- **Labels**: Colored badges for task categorization
- **Search**: Fast database-level search across all tasks with live results
- **Real-time Updates**: Create, modify, and delete tasks/projects immediately
- **Local Trash**: Retains remote-deletion tombstones for up to 30 days and can recreate a task from cached fields

### Backend Abstraction
- **Backend Registry**: Centralized system for managing multiple backend services
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean separation between data access and business logic
- **Entity System**: Sea-ORM entities with UUID primary keys and backend associations
- **Current Status**: Todoist is the only supported backend and remains the main focus. Preliminary architectural work has been completed to enable future support for other task management services.

## AI Proposal Boundary

- OpenAI proposal generation is invoked only from the task-details workflow.
- The selected task and user context are sent initially; bounded read-only tools can expose cached projects or tasks when requested by the model.
- Responses must match a restricted schema before they reach the review interface.
- Todoist mutations occur only after action selection and a separate confirmation, then execute in a fixed order with completion last.
- See [AI Task Management](AI_TASK_MANAGEMENT.md) for user-facing behavior and data flow.
