# Contributing to Terminalist

Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

## Development setup

- Rust 1.78+ (MSRV pinned)
- Install components: `rustup component add rustfmt clippy`

## Workflow

1. Create a feature branch
2. Run format and lint: `cargo fmt && cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
3. Run tests: `cargo test`
4. Build locally: `cargo build --release`
5. Open a PR with a clear title and description

## Commit style

- Use clear, conventional titles when possible
  - feat(...):, fix(...):, docs(...):, chore(...):, refactor(...):
- Keep changes focused and small

## PR checklist

- [ ] Code formatted (`cargo fmt`)
- [ ] Lints pass (`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`)
- [ ] Tests pass (`cargo test`)
- [ ] Updated docs/README if behavior or flags changed

## Running

- Show help: `cargo run -- --help`
- Show version: `cargo run -- --version`
- Debug DB mode: `cargo run -- --debug`

### Install the development version locally

To test the current checkout as the globally available `terminalist` command:

```sh
cargo install --path . --locked --force
terminalist --version
```

The version output includes the Git commit and indicates whether the build
contained uncommitted changes:

```text
terminalist 0.6.0-dev.1 (74f4f78, dirty)
```

Run `command -v terminalist` if the command does not appear to use the expected
installation.

To remove the locally installed binary:

```sh
cargo uninstall terminalist
```

## Versioning

Once development moves beyond a release, set the package version to the next
planned minor release with a numbered prerelease suffix, such as
`0.6.0-dev.1`. This keeps locally installed development builds distinguishable
from the latest stable release.

Increment the `dev.N` number when publishing or sharing another meaningful
development snapshot. Use `0.6.0-rc.1`, `rc.2`, and so on for release
candidates, then remove the suffix for the final `0.6.0` release. Ordinary
commits within the same snapshot do not require a version bump because
`terminalist --version` also identifies the exact Git revision.

Every version change must update the semantic version in `Cargo.toml`, run
`cargo check` to update `Cargo.lock`, and commit both files together. Keep
notable development changes under `CHANGELOG.md`'s `Unreleased` section until
the final release is prepared.

## Reporting issues

Please include:
- Repro steps
- Expected vs actual behavior
- OS and terminal emulator
- `rustc --version`
