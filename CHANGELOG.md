## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **AI Task Management** - Generate review-first OpenAI proposals from task details, let the model inspect cached projects and tasks through read-only tools, revise recommendations and proposed actions, and apply only explicitly confirmed Todoist changes
- **Incremental Todoist Sync** - Persist Todoist Sync API tokens and retrieve only remote changes after the initial full synchronization
- **Smart View Bar** - Show Today, Agenda, Tomorrow, Upcoming, and Trash in an always-visible top navigation bar with keyboard and mouse navigation
- **Persistent Sidebar Rail** - Collapse Projects & Labels to a clickable three-column rail and restore its last state and expanded width on startup
- **Sidebar Hints** - Show `[ ] move · b hide` on the expanded Projects & Labels pane instead of duplicating sidebar navigation in the global shortcut bar
- **Quieter Pane Chrome** - Mute the collapsed sidebar hint and task-list border so task content remains the visual focus
- **Contextual Task Titles** - Identify the active smart view, project, or label in the task-pane title

### Changed
- **Named Priorities** - Present priorities as low, medium, high, and urgent while retaining Todoist's numeric representation only at the integration boundary
- **Responsive Refreshes** - Keep navigation and read-only interactions available while post-sync data reloads finish, blocking only mutations
- **Transactional Sync Tokens** - Commit Todoist deltas and their replacement sync tokens together, with automatic full-sync recovery for rejected tokens
- **Focused Sidebar** - Reserve the sidebar for projects and labels while Left/Right cycles smart views
- **Sidebar Naming** - Rename the navigation panel to Projects & Labels

### Fixed
- **AI Proposal Layout** - Keep wrapped recommendations, action lists, scroll indicators, cursors, and responsive command footers visible within the dialog
- **Empty Trash Navigation** - Keep the permanently available Trash smart view selected when it contains no tasks
